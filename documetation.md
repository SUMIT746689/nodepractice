If you update db then do these steps for migration
You need to have atlas installed in your system

```
go generate ./ent
```

If you have docker then run this command
```
atlas migrate diff migration_name \
  --dir "file://ent/migrate/migrations" \
  --to "ent://ent/schema" \
  --dev-url "docker://mysql/8/ent"
```

and if you don't have docker then run this command
```
atlas migrate diff migration_name \
  --dir "file://ent/migrate/migrations" \
  --to "ent://ent/schema" \
  --dev-url "mysql://root:root@127.0.0.1/pos_online_atlas?parseTime=true"
```

# apply the migration
atlas migrate apply \
  --dir "file://ent/migrate/migrations" \
  --url "mysql://root:root@127.0.0.1/pos_online?parseTime=true"
